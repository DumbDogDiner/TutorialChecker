# TutorialChecker

**This plugin is still WIP**

**TutorialChecker** is a PaperMC plugin that adds a way to check if a player completed the tutorial.

## Usage

To create a section, execute the command `/tutorialchecker sections bind` followed by a name or ID (Displayname can be edited later). 
The user then has to click that button to confirm they read that section. Tutorial sections can be deleted by typing `/tutorialchecker sections remove [section]`

Checking if someone read a specific part (or not) can be done by typing `/tutorialchecker check` followed by the player's name.
